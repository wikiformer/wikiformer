A skilled truffler could more than make up for this investment from the high price of truffles on the gourmet food market. Today, dogs (known as \"truffle hounds\") are commonly used for gathering truffles in place of truffle hogs, as pigs have been known to eat too many truffles in the field. Unlike pigs, dogs have no natural affinity for truffles, and must be specially scent to locate them. A trained Lagotto Romagnolo (an Italian breed recognized for its truffle-finding capability) can cost up to $10,000. Stealing such dogs is a common crime among rival hunters. However, traditionalists argue that the swine have more sensitive noses and their particular taste for truffles leads to a more devoted beast. It is frequent for the hog to be a family pet of the truffler.

Once he discovered how much he enjoyed teaching, he consistently returned to this calling. At the school he established in Nantwich, Cheshire, he taught a wide range of topics to the town's children: Latin (and perhaps Greek), geography, mathematics, and English grammar. Unusually for the time, he also taught natural philosophy. Following the success of this school, he was offered the position of tutor of modern languages and rhetoric at Warrington Academy. In later years, when he lived in Leeds and Birmingham, he created classes for the youth of his parishes; in Birmingham his three classes totaled 150 students and he helped organize the New Meeting Sunday schools for the poor. Having received an excellent education at Daventry, a Dissenting academy, and convinced that education was the key to shaping people and the world's future, Priestley continued to support the Dissenting academies throughout his life. For example, he advised the founders of New College at Hackney on its curriculum and preached a charity sermon on the \"proper Objects of Education\" to help raise money for the school. After emigrating to America in 1794, Priestley continued the educational projects that had always been important to him. He attempted to find funding for the Northumberland Academy and donated his library to it, but the academy did not open until 1813 and closed soon after. He communicated with Thomas Jefferson regarding the proper organization of a university and when Jefferson founded the University of Virginia, it was Priestley's curricular principles that dominated the school. Jefferson also passed Priestley's advice on to Bishop James Madison, whose College of William &amp; Mary also followed Priestley's maxims. Wherever Priestley went, he also instructed people in natural philosophy. In Nantwich, he bought scientific instruments, such as a microscope, for the school, and encouraged his students to give public presentations of their experiments. In Calne, where he was a tutor to the son of Lord Shelburne, Priestley convinced his patron to buy expensive equipment with which to teach his son the fundamentals of natural philosophy. He wrote in his \"Miscellaneous Observations relating to Education\" (1778), published during these years, that children should not only be educated in the ancient subjects of rhetoric and grammar but should also become acquainted with science early in their lives since scientific understanding underpins the progress of the human race. After Priestley moved to Birmingham in 1780, he encouraged the town's children to play with his apparatus and ask questions about his laboratory: the Priestley home became a place of scientific education for the town's children. Priestley's rain gauge and \"perambulator\" (a wheelbarrow for recording distances) delighted them. The boys often played with his air-gun, aiming at a wig of Priestley's which he had fastened to a post. Priestley designed magic lantern shows for them and shocked them with his electrical machine."}, {"subtitle": "Educational philosophy.", "level": 2, "merged_title": ["Joseph Priestley and education", "Educational philosophy."], "text": "In 1765, Priestley dedicated his \"Essay on a Course of Liberal Education for Civil and Active Life\" (1765), to the governing board of Warrington Academy. In it he argues that young people's education should anticipate their practical needs, something he accused the current universities, Dissenting and Establishment alike, of failing to do. In Priestley's eyes, the contemporary focus on a traditional classical education prevented students from acquiring useful skills. This principle of utility guided his unusual curricular recommendations. He proposed that students study English and the modern languages instead of the classical languages, learn practical mathematics, read modern rather than ancient history, and study the constitution and laws of England. He believed that these topics would prepare his students for the commercial middle-class life that most of them would live; he did not believe that the poor should receive this same education, arguing \"it could be of no service to their country, and often a real detriment to themselves.\" In 1766 Warrington Academy replaced its old classical curriculum with Priestley's new liberal arts model. Some scholars of education have argued that this work and his later \"Miscellaneous Observations relating to Education\" (1778) (often reprinted with the \"Essay on Education\") made Priestley the \"most considerable English writer on educational philosophy\" between John Locke and Herbert Spencer."}, {"subtitle": "Grammar.", "level": 2, "merged_title": ["Joseph Priestley and education", "Grammar."], "text": "Priestley's first successful educational venture was the establishment of a local school in Nantwich. Believing that all students should have a good grasp of the English language and its grammar before learning any other language and dismayed at the quality of the instruction manuals available, Priestley wrote his own textbook: \"The Rudiments of English Grammar\" (1761). The book was very successful\u2014it was reprinted for over fifty years. Its humor may have contributed to its popularity; for example, Priestley illustrated the \"couplet\" with this rhyme: Priestley also quoted from the most famous English authors, encouraging the middle-class association between reading and pleasure, a reading that would also, Priestley hoped, foster morality. Priestley's innovations in the teaching and description of English grammar, particularly his efforts to disassociate it from Latin grammar, made his textbook revolutionary and have led twentieth-century scholars to describe him as \"one of the great grammarians of his time.\" \"Rudiments\" influenced all of the major grammarians of the late eighteenth century: Robert Lowth, James Harris, John Horne Tooke and even the American Noah Webster. The resounding success of Priestley's book was one of the reasons that Warrington Academy offered him a teaching position in 1761."}, {"subtitle": "History.", "level": 2, "merged_title": ["Joseph Priestley and education", "History."], "text": "Priestley's philosophy was founded on the fervent belief that a thorough understanding of history was necessary not only to worldly success but also to spiritual growth. He wrote: \"my view was, not merely to make history intelligible to persons who may choose to read it for amusement, but .\u00a0.\u00a0. to facilitate its subserviency to the highest uses to which it can be applied: to contribute to its forming the able statesman and the intelligent and useful citizen.\" His abiding interest in history, particularly modern history, sets Priestley apart from his contemporaries. Priestley was the first person to advocate the serious study of modern history; no other British university was teaching the subject at the time and Oxford would not begin until 1841. While at Warrington Academy, Priestley gave a series of lectures on history and government; in 1788 he finally published them as \"Lectures on History and General Policy\". They cover a wide array of topics\u2014\"forms of government, the feudal system, the rise of corporations, law, agriculture, commerce, the arts, finance and taxation, colonies, manners, population, war and peace\"\u2014demonstrating how all-encompassing Priestley believed the study of history to be. In this text, he narrates a version of history in which all events are \"an exhibition of the ways of God;\" studying history and nature, according to Priestley, \"leads us to the knowledge of his perfections and of his will.\" Understanding history thus allows one to comprehend the natural laws God established and the perfection towards which they allow the world to tend. This millennial outlook is tied together with Priestley's belief in scientific progress and the improvement of the human race. Priestley maintained that each age improves upon the previous one and studying history allows people to see and participate in that progress. In his \"Essay on the First Principles of Government\" (1768) he writes: Highly as we think of the \"wisdom of our ancestors\" we justly think of ourselves, of the present age, wiser and . . . must see that we can . . . improve upon institutions that have been transmitted to us. Let us not doubt but that every generation in posterity will be as much superior to us in political, and all kinds of knowledge, and that they will be able to improve upon the best civil and religious institutions that we can prescribe for them. [Priestley's emphasis] This millennial conception of history was in direct contrast to the two dominant historical paradigms of the time: Edward Gibbon's decline narrative found in his \"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\" and David Hume's cyclical narrative found in his \"History of England\". Unlike Gibbon and Hume, Priestley did not limit himself to narrating a version of history in these \"Lectures\"; he also presented a method for historical research and was one of the first to argue for the primacy of original documents in the study of history. He also contended that much could be learned from \"material evidence\" of former civilizations, such as \"ancient coins, medals and inscriptions,\" as well as \"exchequer rolls, public and private ledger books, letters, diaries, monetary, financial and exchange systems, systems of fortifications and city plans . . . [in addition to] ballads and works of fiction.\" The book was well received and was employed by many educational institutions, such as the Dissenting academy at Hackney, Brown, Princeton, Yale and Cambridge. The theory underpinning Priestley's millennial view of history and his educational philosophy, was David Hartley's theory of association. Hartley's associationism, an expansion of John Locke's theories in \"Essay Concerning Human Understanding\" (1690) and laid out in \"Observations on Man\" (1749), postulated that the human mind operated according to natural laws and that the most important law for the formation of the self was \"associationism.\" For Hartley, associationism was a physical process: vibrations in the physical world traveled through the nerves attached to people's sense organs and ended up in their brains. The brain connected the vibrations of whatever sensory input it was receiving with whatever feelings or ideas that the brain was simultaneously \"thinking.\" These \"associations\" were impossible to avoid, formed as they were simply by experiencing the world; they were also the foundation of a person's character. Locke famously warns against letting \"a foolish maid\" convince a child that \"goblins and sprites\" are associated with the darkness, for \"darkness shall ever afterwards bring with it those frightful ideas, and they shall be so joined, that he can no more bear the one than the other.\" Associationism provided the scientific basis for Priestley's belief that man is \"perfectible\" and served as the foundation for all of his pedagogical innovations. Because Priestley viewed education as one of the primary forces shaping a person's character as well as the basis of morality, he, unusually for his time, promoted the education of women. Alluding to the language of Locke's \"Essay Concerning Human Understanding\", he wrote: \"certainly, the minds of women are capable of the same improvement, and the same furniture, as those of men.\" He argued that if women were to care for children and be intellectually stimulating companions for their husbands, they had to be well-educated. Although Priestley advocated education for middle-class women, he did not extend this logic to the poor."}, {"subtitle": "Charts of biography and history.", "level": 3, "merged_title": ["Joseph Priestley and education", "History.", "Charts of biography and history."], "text": "As a supplement to his lectures on history, Priestley also designed and published \"A Chart of Biography\" (1765) and a \"New Chart of History\" (1769) (which he dedicated to Benjamin Franklin). These charts and their accompanying \"Descriptions\" would allow students, Priestley said, to \"trace out distinctly the dependence of events to distribute them into such periods and divisions as shall lay the whole claim of past transactions in a just and orderly manner.\" The \"Chart of Biography\" covers a vast timespan, from 1200 BC to 1800 AD, and includes two thousand names. Priestley organized his list into six categories: Statesman and Warriors; Divines and Metaphysicians; Mathematicians and Physicians (natural philosophers were placed here); Poets and Artists; Orators and Critics (prose fiction authors were placed here); and Historians and Antiquarians (lawyers were placed here). Priestley's \"principle of selection\" was fame, not merit; therefore, as he mentions, the chart is a reflection of current opinion. He also wanted to ensure that his readers would recognize the entires on the chart. Priestley had difficulty assigning his all of his people to individual categories; he attempted to list them in the category under which their most important work had been done. Machiavelli is therefore listed as a historian rather than a statesman and Cicero is listed as a statesman instead of an orator. The chart was also arranged in order of importance; \"statesmen are placed on the lower margin, where they are easier to see, because they are the names most familiar to readers.\" The \"Chart of History\" lists events in 106 separate locations; it illustrates Priestley's belief that the entire world's history was significant, a relatively new development in the eighteenth century, which had begun with Voltaire and William Robertson. The world's history is divided up into the following geographical categories: Scandinavia, Poland, Russia, Great Britain, Spain, France, Italy, Turkey in Europe, Turkey in Asia, Germany, Persia, India, China, Africa and America. Priestley aimed to show the history of empires and the passing of power; the subtitle of the \"Description\" that accompanied the chart was \"A View of the Principle Revolutions of Empire that have taken place in the World\" and he wrote that: The capital use [of the \"Charts\" was as] a most excellent mechanical help to the knowledge of history, impressing the imagination indelibly with a just image of the rise, progress, extent, duration, and contemporary state of all the considerable empires that have ever existed in the world. As Arthur Sheps in his article about the \"Charts\" explains, \"the horizontal line conveys an idea of the duration of fame, influence, power and domination. A vertical reading conveys an impression of the contemporaneity of ideas, events and people. The number or density of entries . . . tells us about the vitality of any age.\" Voids in the chart indicated intellectual Dark Ages, for example. Both \"Charts\" were popular for decades\u2014the \"A New Chart of History\" went through fifteen editions by 1816. The trustees of Warrington were so impressed with Priestley's lectures and charts that they arranged for the University of Edinburgh to grant him a Doctor of Law degree in 1764."}, {"subtitle": "Religious education.", "level": 2, "merged_title": ["Joseph Priestley and education", "Religious education."], "text": "Priestley pondered what form the best religious education would take throughout his life. In the 1760s, when he was a student at Daventry Academy, he imbibed the pedagogical principles of its founder, Philip Doddridge; although he was dead, Doddridge's emphasis on academic rigor and freedom of thought lived on at the school and impressed Priestley. These ideals would always be a part of Priestley's educational programs. He began writing one of these while still at Daventry, the \"Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion\". However, he did not publish the work until 1772, when he was at Leeds. In an effort to increase and stabilize membership at his church there, he taught three religious education classes. He subdivided the young people of the congregation into three categories: young men from 18\u201330 to whom he taught \"the elements of natural and revealed religion\" (young women may or may not be included in this group); children under 14 to whom he taught \"the first elements of religious knowledge by way of a short catechism in the plainest and most familiar language possible\"; and \"an intermediate class\" to whom he taught \"knowledge of the Scriptures only.\" Unlike the later Sunday schools established by Robert Raikes, Priestley aimed his classes at middle-class Rational Dissenters; he wanted to teach them \"the principles of natural religion and the evidences and doctrine of revelation in a regular and systematic course,\" something their parents could not provide. Priestley wrote texts for the courses he envisioned: \"A Catechism for Children and Young Persons\" (1767), which went through eleven English-language editions; and \"A Scripture Catechism, consisting of a Series of Questions, with References to the Scriptures instead of Answers\" (1772), which went through six British editions by 1817. He aimed to write non-sectarian \"Catechisms\", but in this he failed. He offended many orthodox readers by focusing on God's benevolence instead of on Adam's sin and Christ's atonement. Priestley implemented this same system of religious instruction over a decade later in Birmingham, when he became a minister at New Meeting."}, {"subtitle": "Bibliography.", "level": 2, "merged_title": ["Joseph Priestley and education", "Bibliography."], "text": "For a complete bibliography of Priestley's works, see the list of works by Joseph Priestley."}], "max_level": 3, "abstract": ["", "Joseph Priestley ( \u2013 8 February 1804) was a British natural philosopher, Dissenting clergyman, political theorist, and theologian.

His conviction came partly because the jury was shown photographs of a closet door, with fist holes in it. It was later proven that this damage happened before David even moved into the house. In 1991, David's conviction was overturned when the Illinois Appellate Court reversed the conviction outright, holding that the evidence against him had been no more probative than that against his wife.

Reynolds next decided to make the move to Los Angeles, soon to be joined by fellow guitarist Mick Zane, to start an all original metal band. When the duo was unable to find suitable players for their new venture, they convinced Neal, bassist Mark Behn and drummer Pete Laufman to move down from Portland as well after the initial Malice demo caused a stir and garnered label interest from Brian Slagel of Metal Blade Records. \"Captive of Light\" and \"Kick You Down\" from the demo were both selected to appear on \"Metal Massacre I\" alongside tracks by Metallica, Ratt, Steeler and others. Malice made their L.A. live debut in November 1982 at the Troubadour headlining a bill with Metallica and Pandemonium as opening acts. Other memorable L.A. shows included opening up for then new major label signees Armored Saint at Perkins Palace in Pasadena, CA in the spring of 1984. Adding drummer Cliff Carothers, formerly with the bands Snow and Assassin, in place of Pete Laufman, Malice set about recording new demos with producer Michael Wagener and soon found themselves in the midst of a label bidding war. Eventually, the band signed with Atlantic Records in the summer of 1984 and released their debut album, \"In The Beginning...\", in 1985. It consisted of songs the band had cut with Wagener and material recorded with Ashley Howe producing. Malice teamed up with producer Max Norman for their sophomore album, \"License to Kill\", released in 1987. Dave Mustaine and Dave Ellefson of Megadeth and Black 'n Blue's Jaime St. James, Tommy Thayer and Jeff Warner provided backing vocals on two songs, \"License to Kill\" and \"Chain Gang Woman.\" The band toured with Alice Cooper, W.A.S.P. and Mot\u00f6rhead, among others. They were also the support act for Slayer on their 1987 \"Reign In Pain\" European tour, an ill-fated trip that saw Malice faced with open hostility from the headliner's rabid crowds which forced the band to drop off the bill once the trek reached Germany. In late 1987, Jay Reynolds left the band to join Megadeth in place of Chris Poland but was ultimately ousted several months later when bandleader Dave Mustaine decided on hiring Jay's former roommate and guitar teacher, Jeff Young, instead. The band also parted ways with James Neal and carried on with a new vocalist, Mark Weitz, but finally split up in late 1988. The 1988 film Vice Versa featured Malice in a concert sequence, filmed in Champaign, IL, performing \"Crazy In The Night\". Metal Blade would issue a third Malice release, \"Crazy In The Night\", in 1989. It contained 3 songs recorded with Neal and \"Vice Versa\", with producer Paul Sabu providing lead vocals. Following the demise of Malice, Jay Reynolds formed War Party with former Megadeth drummer Chuck Behler. Mick Zane and Mark Behn would team up with former Black 'n Blue drummer Pete Holmes and vocalist Mark Isom under the name Monster. The band's sole album, \"Through the Eyes of the World\", surfaced on Long Island Records in Europe in 1995 and on Pulse Records in the U.S. in 1997. In 1999, EastWest Japan re-issued both \"In The Beginning...\" and \"License to Kill\" on CD; U.S. label Wounded Bird would follow suit in 2004. Jay Reynolds joined a revamped Metal Church line-up in early 2004 and recorded 2 albums with the band, \"Weight of the World\" (2004) and \"A Light in the Dark\" (2006), before exiting again in 2008. In 2006, Malice announced that they would be doing a reunion tour but canceled a number of European tour dates the following year. The band did perform a handful of shows in the U.S. utilizing the services of Last Empire and future Vicious Rumors vocalist Brian Allen. The band finally returned to Europe in April 2011 to co-headline the Keep It True XIV festival in Germany with new vocalist James Rivera (Helstar, Vicious Rumors). In 2008, Malice issued an archives release, \"The Rare and Unreleased\", on Retrospect Records containing all 4 songs from the \"Crazy In The Night\" EP and various early demos. In late 2011, it was announced that Malice had signed a record deal with Germany's SPV/Steamhammer; Robert Cardenas of Agent Steel was confirmed as the band's new live bass player. \"New Breed of Godz\", containing 4 new songs and re-recordings of 8 songs culled from \"In The Beginning...\" and \"License to Kill\", was released in May 2012.

Later, a committee of 11 members was chosen by ballot to report their decision to the House. In 1868, the Parliamentary Elections Act 1868 (UK) was passed conferring jurisdiction on two judges of the Queen's Bench to determine these issues.

In 1867, Queensland had set up a parliamentary committee called the \u201cCommittee of Elections and Qualifications\u201d to determine disputes.

On second preferences, the petitioner received 751 of those second preference votes and the elected person received 879 votes. This meant that the elected person received 9,308 votes whilst the petitioner received 9,292 votes. The end result was the elected person was elected by a majority of 16 votes. The court analysed the voting process and determined that there were 35 instances of invalid voting or correct voting which had been rejected. In the circumstances, the Justice Ambrose ordered a fresh election for the electorate of Mundingburra. In the same year, the court also determined a preliminary issue for a petition concerning the election return for the Electoral district of Greenslopes. In that case, the petitioner alleged that the Electoral Commission has not followed procedures in counting declaration votes, and as a result, the whole election for Greenslopes should be declared as invalid. The court dismissed the application noting that even if it was correct, the number of informal would total 3,504 votes instead of 420 votes, and the elected person would have received 8,143 votes as against the petitioner\u2019s 7,946 votes.

Turner, U.S. naval commander of amphibious forces for the south Pacific. The 2nd Marine Raider Battalion was a unique unit in the Marine Corps. The battalion's original organization and tactics were based around Communist Chinese precepts Carlson had witnessed while serving as an observer with the Communists during the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937-1938. These precepts included promoting equality between officers and enlisted men and making decisions through collective consensus. Unlike the 1st Marine Raider Battalion, which focused on commando tactics, the 2nd Battalion trained to operate as a guerrilla force. The training included an emphasis on infiltration tactics and often involved tactical exercises conducted at night. The battalion was organized into six self-contained rifle companies and a headquarters company. Before landing at Guadalcanal elements of the battalion had seen action as part of the garrison of Midway Atoll during the Battle of Midway in May 1942 and the near disastrous Makin Island raid in August. In early November, Vandegrift, fearing that the Japanese were planning an assault on the Lunga perimeter from the east using Sh\u014dji's forces plus additional reinforcements, launched an operation against the Japanese units at Koli Point. Beginning on 4 November, two battalions of U.S. Marines and two battalions of U.S. Army troops attacked and attempted to encircle Sh\u014dji's men at Gavaga Creek near the village of Tetere in the Koli Point area. As the American troops were attempting to destroy Sh\u014dji's force, Vandegrift ordered Carlson's raiders to march overland from Aola Bay toward Koli Point to cut off any of Sh\u014dji's forces that escaped the encirclement attempt. On 5 November, two transport ships headed for Espiritu Santo to pick up three companies from Carlson's battalion while Carlson prepared his two companies already on Guadalcanal to march overland towards Koli Point.

At the Reko, Carlson learned that the local Christian mission had recently been raided by Japanese troops who had killed two of the missionaries before moving west. Pushing across the river with one platoon of troops, Carlson encountered a small group of Japanese who shot and severely wounded the native scout leading the Marine column. Returning fire, the Marines killed two Japanese soldiers and drove off another three or four. Carlson's main body then arrived and the column bivouacked for the night. On 8 November, the column continued through the jungle to the northwest, striking the coast at the Kena River, and made camp at the village of Tasimboko, from Aola Bay. The next day they crossed the Berande and Balasuna rivers and reached the village of Binu\u2014 southwest of Tasimboko\u2014in the afternoon. At Binu, about southeast of Koli Point, Carlson established his base camp and prepared to block the movement of any Japanese forces from Koli to the east and south. The other three raider companies arrived at Aola on 8 November. On 9 November, they moved by landing craft to Tasimboko and, on 10 November marched overland\u2014guided by native scouts\u2014toward Binu. On the way, the raiders encountered a small group of Japanese soldiers and killed three of them before arriving at Binu in the afternoon of the same day. In the meantime, Hyakutake ordered Sh\u014dji to abandon his positions at Koli and rejoin Japanese forces at Kokumbona in the Matanikau area. Although American forces had almost completely encircled Sh\u014dji's troops along Gavaga Creek at Koli, a gap existed by way of a swampy creek in the southern side of the American lines. Taking advantage of this route, Sh\u014dji's men began to escape. The Americans closed the gap in their lines on 11 November, but by then Sh\u014dji and between 2,000 and 3,000 of his men had escaped into the jungle to the south.

The remaining company, \"B\", stayed behind to provide security for the Binu base camp. At 10:00, Company C, which had marched directly west toward the village of Asamana, encountered a large body of Sh\u014dji's troops camped near the Metapona River and were quickly pinned down by rifle, machinegun, and mortar fire. Carlson responded by directing Companies D and E to come to C's aid, attacking the Japanese forces from two different directions. As Companies D and E moved in C's direction, both encountered large concentrations of Sh\u014dji's soldiers and, by 12:30, were involved in intense firefights. At 15:00, Company D commander Captain Charles McAuliffe\u2014with nine of his men\u2014unexpectedly marched into the Binu base camp. McAuliffe reported to Carlson that soon after he had made contact with the Japanese forces, he and one of his squads had become cut off from the rest of his company. After extricating themselves with difficulty, McAuliffe and the men with him had decided to retreat back to the base camp. McAuliffe reported that, as far as he knew, the rest of his company had been annihilated. A short time later, however, the rest of D Company arrived at the base camp, led by Gunnery Sergeant George Schrier, after successfully disengaging from the firefight. Carlson summarily relieved McAuliffe for what he later described as \"total ineptitude for leadership in battle\" and placed Captain Joe Griffith in command of Company D. Along with Company F, which had returned to the base camp, Carlson proceeded to the area where Company C was engaged, arriving at 16:30. Carlson ordered Company F to attack the Japanese positions facing Company C at 17:15. In the meantime, the Japanese troops departed the area, which Company F soon confirmed. Leaving Company F at the scene, Carlson returned to Binu with Company C, arriving at 22:00. Company E arrived at Binu about the same time and reported that they had caught a Japanese company crossing a river in the open and killed many of them before withdrawing. Carlson then took Company B and returned to the area that Company F was guarding, arriving at daybreak on 12 November. The Marines had suffered 10 killed in the day's actions and estimated that they had killed 120\u00a0Japanese soldiers. Carlson and the two companies, with Company B leading, marched west towards the village of Asamana on the Metapona River. While crossing the river, the Marines captured two Japanese soldiers and killed a third who happened by in a native boat, then attacked and occupied Asamana, surprising and killing several Japanese soldiers in the village. Signs in Japanese in the village indicated that it was being used as a rallying location for Sh\u014dji's forces. Occupying defensive positions around the village and river crossing, the raiders killed 25\u00a0Japanese soldiers that approached the village during the remainder of the day. The next day, when a company-sized column of Japanese soldiers approached Asamana, the raiders called in artillery fire from the 1st Battalion, 10th Marine Regiment, killing many of the Japanese and causing the rest to scatter and retreat away from the village. Carlson and the Marines with him returned to Binu on 14 November to rest and reprovision. In the same day, a patrol from the raiders Company F wiped out a 15-man Japanese encampment discovered by the native scouts. On 15 November, Carlson's battalion changed their base camp from Binu to Asamana. By this time, however, Sh\u014dji's units were no longer in the area, having continued their march deep into the interior of Guadalcanal en route to the Matanikau.

Carlson's raiders were also to seek out and destroy several Japanese artillery pieces that had been delivering harassing fire against Henderson Field for several weeks. The raiders set up the new base camp about southeast of the Lunga perimeter on 20 November and rested and replenished until 24 November. On 25 November, Carlson's Company A arrived from Espiritu Santo and joined the raiders. On 27 November, the battalion relocated further up the Tenaru River and established two auxiliary patrol bases upstream and downstream, respectively. On 28 November, Companies B and D patrolled across the Lunga River and bivouacked in the Mount Austen area, southwest of the Lunga perimeter. The same day, Companies A and F patrolled further south between the Lunga and the Tenaru. On 30 November, the raiders found a Japanese 75 mm mountain gun and anti-tank gun emplaced on a ridge about south of the Lunga perimeter. As one squad of six Marines from Company F patrolled near where the guns were discovered, they entered a hidden Japanese camp and found themselves among about 100\u00a0Japanese soldiers resting under shelters with their weapons stacked around trees in the center of the camp. In the resulting melee, the raider squad killed about 75 of the Japanese. The rest escaped. The raiders rested on 1 December and received some provisions by airdrop. On 2 December, Carlson fanned out his patrols around the Lunga River. Company B discovered 10\u00a0Japanese camped by the river and killed all of them. None of the other companies encountered any Japanese, but one discovered another 75\u00a0mm mountain gun. Late in the day, Carlson received orders to terminate the patrol and take his troops into the Lunga perimeter the next day. On 3 December, Carlson sent Companies C, D, and E east towards the Tenaru river while Companies A, B, and F headed west towards Mount Austen. Companies C, D, and E reached the lower Tenaru and entered friendly lines at Lunga Point without incident. Companies A, B, and F, however, encountered a Japanese patrol near the summit of Mount Austen. In a close-quarters fight in the jungle, 25\u00a0Japanese were killed and four Marines were seriously wounded, one of whom died later. The next day, Companies A, B, and F set out with the intention of entering the Lunga perimeter near the Matanikau River.

By the time Sh\u014dji's forces reached the Lunga River in mid-November, about halfway to the Matanikau, only 1,300\u00a0men remained with the main body. When Sh\u014dji reached the 17th Army positions west of the Matanikau, only 700-800 survivors were still with him. Survivors from Sh\u014dji's force later participated in the Battle of Mount Austen, the Galloping Horse, and the Sea Horse in December 1942 and January 1943. During the 29\u00a0days of the patrol, Carlson's raiders hiked approximately to cover a straight-line distance of about from Aola Bay to the Matanikau River. Carlson claimed that his troops killed 488\u00a0Japanese soldiers and captured or destroyed large amounts of equipment, including two howitzers and various small arms and ammunition. The 2nd Raiders suffered 16\u00a0killed and 17\u00a0wounded (plus 2\u00a0wounded native guides). Non-battle casualties totaled 225, of which 125\u00a0suffered from malaria, 29 from dysentery, and 71 from ringworm or jungle rot. Most of the remaining raiders were also suffering some type of physical ailment. On 17 December, the raiders departed Guadalcanal by ship and arrived back at their home camp on Espiritu Santo on 20 December. At Espiritu Santo, the unit continued to be affected by the lingering tropical diseases many had contracted during the Guadalcanal patrol. In the second week of March 1943, the 2nd\u00a0Raiders were declared unfit for combat duty, although this finding was never announced in an official document. The 2nd Marine Raiders did not participate as a unit in a combat operation until the Bougainville campaign beginning on 1 November 1943.

Investor Mike Lewis was instrumental in financing and staging Heavens Cafe. The Tributary Music Label released a live CD of Heavens Cafe to the progressive rock community in 2000. Previously, Miner co-founded the California-based art rock band Mantra Sunrise in 1992 with singer-bassist Joel Bissing and drummer Wayne Garabedian. The band produced the self-titled album \"Mantra Sunrise\" in 1994. In 2001 \"A Passage to Clear\" was released by Miner's Art Rock Circus, also being conceptual in nature. The album featured two female vocalists, Karyn Anderson, and Karen Marquart. The album was not as well received as Heavens Cafe'. Collaborating with drummer and composer Nolan Stolz, Miner rebuilt the Art Rock Circus from the ground up, and in 2005 released a double CD Tell a Vision. The extensive keyboard palate in addition to Miner's eclectic guitar stylings found an accepting progressive rock audience. In 2005, Miner wrote and constructed guitar parts for the K\u00b2 (band) album Book of the Dead that would integrate around the lead parts of Allan Holdsworth. Musically, Miner is known for his use of several alternate guitar tunings, and this is evident in nearly all his compositions. The use of a double necked guitar has enabled the performer to switch from one tuning to another within the same song in a live situation. His use of odd time signatures is apparent in the majority of his work as a composer, particularly in Heavens Cafe, in which the majority of the album features unorthodox metering. Other distinct characteristics of the composer include the absence of repeating choruses. Drum and bass parts are usually hinting toward melody, rather than standard rock fare.

To cut his expenditure he decided to go to Boston which was less costly than Chicago. On August 25, 1893, at Boston, Vivekananda met Wright for the first time. Wright was amazed by Vivekananda's profound knowledge and urged him to attend the upcoming Parliament as a speaker. He was so much astonished that he invited Vivekananda to stay in his house as a guest. From August 25 to 27, 1893, Vivekananda stayed at Wright's house at 8 Arlington Street. When Vivekananda told Wright that he did not have any credential or bona fide to attend the Parliament he reportedly told him\u2014 \"To ask you, Swami, for your credentials is like asking the sun about its right to shine.\" Then Wright himself wrote a letter of introduction to the chairman of the Parliament of the World's Religion and suggested to him to invite Vivekananda as a speaker stating \u2014 \"Here is a man who is more learned than all our learned professors put together.\" Wright also learned that Vivekananda did not have enough money to buy a railway ticket, so, he bought him a railway ticket too. Even after the conclusion of the Parliament, they kept in touch with each other through correspondence. Vivekananda remained ever thankful to Wright for his help and kindness. In a letter written on 18 June 1894, Vivekananda addressed Wright as brother and wrote \u2014 \"Stout hearts like yours are not common, my brother. This is a queer place \u2014 this world of ours.

Here he became acquainted with Charles Borromeo. On his return to his native country he preached with success at Roanne, Avignon, N\u00eemes, Grenoble, and Marseilles. An acquaintance with Henry IV of France soon ripened into friendship. The Archbishopric of Arles being vacant, the king offered it to Coton, who refused it. Father Coton had for two years previous to the death of Henry been confessor to his son, the young Dauphin. The king having recalled the exiled Jesuits to France, their enemies could not pardon the influence Father Coton had in bringing this about, and an attempt was made to assassinate him. Some writers have pretended that Coton was not above suspicion on the doctrine of regicide, and when Henry IV was assassinated, they accused Coton of defending Ravaillac, the king's murderer. If his enemies at court had any knowledge that he held such views they failed to make it public. In defense of the Jesuits, Coton issued \"Lettre d\u00e9claratoire de la doctrine de P\u00e8res J\u00e9suites\", which made him the target of much hostility and suspicion. In 1608, Father Coton called Father Pierre Biard away from his professorship at Lyon ordering him to take charge of the mission in the new French colony at Acadia.  In September, 1610, the biting satire \"Anti-Coton, in which it is proved that the Jesuits are guilty of parricide against Henri IV\" was followed by many pamphlets for and against the Jesuits. The Anti-Coton pamphlet attacked the Jesuits, and especially Father Coton, the confessor of Henry IV, of whose murder the Jesuits had been accused by their enemies. Daurignac says (Hist. Soc. Jesus, vol. i., p. 295) that this pamphlet was attributed to Pierre Du Moulin, a Protestant minister of Charenton. This and other similar attacks on the Jesuits had been circulated in Canada, and had prejudiced against them even many Catholics. Coton continued in his capacity as confessor to the new king, Louis XIII, until 1617, when he left the court at the age of fifty-four and withdrew to the novitiate at Lyon. He then traversed the provinces of the South as a missionary, and went to Milan, Loreto, and Rome to fulfil the vows the reigning king had made to the Blessed Virgin, St. Charles, and St. Peter. He returned to France as provincial of the Society and preached at Paris in the church of S. Gervaise; the king and the whole court flocked to hear him. At this period a book published by Santarelli, an Italian Jesuit, who attributed to the pope the power of deposing kings who were guilty of certain crimes, and under such circumstances of absolving their subjects from their allegiance, was the object of severe attacks from the many enemies of the Society of Jesus in France. The doctrines which Santarelli expounded had been accepted in the Middle Ages, and were still professed by the Ultramontane theologians, although they had become impossible in practice. This book was in Paris, under the rule of Richelieu, construed into a provocation to regicide and rebellion. These views were attributed to every Jesuit. The Parliament demanded that all Jesuits residing in France should be called upon to sign a protestation disavowing all the doctrines contained in Santarelli's treatise. Coton was ill at the time. On his death-bed he was visited by an envoy of Parliament, who informed him of the condemnation pronounced against Santarelli and the severe measures that threatened his brethren.

The conspiracy allegation originates with \"Bugie di sangue in Vaticano\" (1999), written by \"a group of Vatican ecclesiastics and lays who cannot continue to avail, with their silence, official truth told by the Vatican\". This document suggests that Estermann was killed in the course of a supposed struggle between the Opus Dei and masonic parties within the Vatican hierarchy, both attempting to annex the Swiss guard. According to a piece edited by Fabio Croce, the three were all murdered by \"a Vatican killer\", due to Estermann's supposed knowledge of the small state's trafficks. In his 2008 book \"Poteri forti\", Ferruccio Pinotti asserts that Estermann repeatedly travelled to Poland in 1981 to coordinate the arrival of military equipment from Scandinavia to support the Polish anti-communist organization Solidarity. A competing hypothesis was published in \"L'Agent secret du Vatican\" (2004), by journalist Victor Guitard and Markus Wolf, former No. 2 of the East German secret police Stasi. These authors declared that Estermann had been a Stasi agent since 1979. British journalist John Follain undertook extensive interviews to inform his book, \"City of Secrets: The Truth behind the murders at the Vatican\" (2006). Follain dismisses speculation that Estermann, his wife, and Tornay were murdered by an external fourth party or that Estermann was a spy for the former East German government. Follain's research indicated that C\u00e9dric Tornay did indeed kill his commander and the commander's wife before turning the gun on himself. Reportedly Tornay found the running of the Swiss Guard archaic, and resented the dominance of the Swiss German majority contingent. According to Follain, Tornay turned to Alois Estermann for affection and the two had a short homosexual affair, but their relationship deteriorated into acrimony as Tornay realised that Estermann had betrayed him with another guard. Estermann's close links to the Opus Dei movement, and his final refusal to award the Benemerenti medal for three years' service led to further frustration and Tornay's ultimate decision to kill Estermann, according to Follain.
